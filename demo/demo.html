  	<h1>Demo Website on Positions

1.  Position static: 
HTML elements are positioned static by default.
Static positioned elements are not affected by the top, bottom, left, and right properties.
An element with position: static; is not positioned in any special way; it is always positioned according to the normal flow of the page:

2.  Position relative:

an element’s original position remains in the flow of the document, just like the static value. But now left/right/top/bottom/z-index will work. The positional properties “nudge” the element from the original position in that direction.

3.  Position fixed:
the element is removed from the flow of the document like absolutely positioned elements. In fact they behave almost the same, only fixed positioned elements are always relative to the document, not any particular parent, and are unaffected by scrolling.


4.  Position absolute:
the element is removed from the flow of the document and other elements will behave as if it’s not even there whilst all the other positional properties will work on it.


5.  Position sticky:

the element is treated like a relativevalue until the scroll location of the viewport reaches a specified threshold, at which point the element takes a fixed position where it is told to stick.

6.  Inherit: 
the position value doesn’t cascade, so this can be used to specifically force it to, and inherit the positioning value from its parent.

Syntax:
- position:static;
- position:absolute;
- position:fixed;
- position:absolute;
- position:relative;
- position: inherit;
