      <p>FEARLESS GIRL V CHARGING BULL: NEW YORK'S BIGGEST PUBLIC ART CONTROVERSY IN YEARS</p>

        <p>Almost all the public statues of people in New York City depict men. There is a huge green exception in New York harbor. But Lady Liberty wasn’t real, not like the men who inspired the 23 statues planted in Central Park alone. (There are no statues of real women in Central Park, though there is one of Alice in Wonderland.)</p>
        <p>The latest, most famous statue in New York City does not depict a historical figure, either, or a woman, but she is a she. Fearless Girl, facing off with Charging Bull near Wall Street at the foot of Broadway, has given the city its biggest public art controversy since Christo and Jeanne-Claude draped Central Park with orange “gates” in 2005.</p>
        <p>'Charging Bull' sculptor says New York's 'Fearless Girl' statue violates his rights
        As with The Gates, not all critics are enamored with Fearless Girl. And the detractors include Arturo Di Modica, the sculptor behind Charging Bull, who held a press conference this week to say his 1989 work had been hijacked and violated.</p>
        <p>The idea for the bull was never to represent the possible trampling death of a small child, his lawyers explained. The idea was to project optimism and strength amid adversity, which at the time of the sculpture’s creation included a market crash that sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average down a terrifying 22%.</p>
        <p>The public loved Charging Bull from the day it was planted under cover of night, guerrilla-style, in front of the stock exchange. They still love it, as any visitor to the current site of the artwork, at the north end of Bowling Green Park, can see.</p>
        <p>Tourists from all over the world mob the bull all day long, posing for photos with a hand gripping its lower horn or, even more popularly, its huge testicles. The bull’s balls are as polished as Victor Noir’s penis at Père Lachaise.</p>
        <p>But Fearless Girl, about 20ft away, is equally popular, in a markedly and interestingly different way. All day long, with rarely a second’s lag, people take turns linking arms and posing with the piece, including many young girls encouraged forward by their moms and dads.</p>
        <p>Fearless Girl, by artist Kristen Visbal, has plainly become, for very many of the thousands of people who visit her daily, exactly what the global asset management firm that had her installed for International Women’s Day last month asserted she was: a symbol of feminist strength and possibility.</p>
        <p>Adam Burkemper, who was in town this week with his family from Missouri, approached the statue with his 11-year-old daughter.</p>

        <p>“See the little girl?” Burkemper asked. “That’s a little girl taking on a bull. Cool, huh? When I saw that, I thought of you.” His daughter smiled.</p>

        <p>“I think this is a really important statue,” said Shari Mohammed, who had come in from Brooklyn to check it out. “And it’s good for a lot of younger girls. It’s not just adults.”</p>

        <p>Mohammed pointed out that a statue of a woman or girl in the city was rare, and said Fearless Girl was a symbol for “equality for women in general”.</p>

        <p>I think this is a really important statue. And it’s good for a lot of younger girls. It’s not just adults. </p>
        <p>“I think it’s really sad that we still don’t have equal pay in the workplace in 2017,” she said. “Why is that even a debate? It’s preposterous.”</p>

        <p>A woman who said she had worked around the corner for better than a decade – KP from Beaver Street, she asked to be called – nodded her head in approval, to no one in particular, as she approached Fearless Girl. After Di Modica’s press conference, she said, she had wanted to see what all the fuss was about.</p>

        <p>“Look at the look she’s giving. Look at her confidence,” KP said. “You know what she’s saying? She’s saying women have balls, too. Women have balls, too.”</p>

        <p>KP gave a fist bump and walked away. “Liberation!” she said.</p>

        <p>The meaning of Fearless Girl, however, is not confined to the rather perilous traffic island where she stands. (Note to the mayor: on a recent visit to the statue, which though ringed by crowd control fences is still in the middle of Broadway, this reporter witnessed three incidents in the space of a half hour that got disturbingly close to violating your Vision Zero for pedestrians deaths in traffic in New York City.)</p>

        <p>Di Modica is not alone in his objections. Critics have said the statue is too facile or plucky, have questioned why the women’s movement is represented by a young girl and not a grown adult, and have questioned the motives of the statue’s sponsor, State Street Global Advisors, which installed the sculpture with a plaque reading, ‘‘Know the power of women in leadership. SHE makes a difference.”</p>

        <p>SHE is the trading symbol for one of State Street’s index funds. That is a bad look, perhaps, but the company is known for gender diversity initiatives, and spokeswoman Anne McNally said that 45% of hires and 43% of all recent executive promotions globally at the company had been women.</p>

        <p>“It’s a call to action to ourselves as much as to our industry,” McNally told the Guardian.</p>

        <p>The mixed up and changing roles of Wall Street in the clash between the statues has not simplified the conflict. Di Modica wishes to protect the meaning of his bull, but in the public eye that meaning has already evolved, a lot, since the late 1980s.</p>


        <p>'Charging Bull' sculptor calls for New York to remove 'Fearless Girl' statue</p>
        <p>Back then, as loathed as Wall Street greed may have been, at least the bankers were not turning Main Street mortgages into weaponized financial products that would explode the economy, and then not going to prison for it. Wall Street’s popularity is at a low and, mistakenly or not, Charging Bull is its most recognizable symbol.</p>

        <p>Jenniea Carter, who was visiting Fearless Girl with Mohammed, had sympathy for Di Modica’s concerns but said that times had changed since the original installation.</p>

        <p>“I can see his argument, because when I see the two of them, the bull is not a symbol of strength,” Carter said. “It’s more a barrier or an obstacle. But I think that, because it is the 21st century, times have changed, and this has to change.”</p>

        <p>Di Modica did not reply to a request for comment. Visbal, reached by phone late Thursday, said she was exhausted from fielding nonstop media requests.</p>

        <p>“This certainly was not meant to be a confrontational piece,” Visbal said. She said she had twice tried to reach Di Modica to talk about it, without success.</p>

        <p>Fearless Girl is currently slated for removal next year, but public affection for the statue, as in the case of Charging Bull, could secure a longer stay.</p>

        <p>“The history of the piece is really up to the people of New York and the public,” Visbal said.</p>

        <p>Burkemper, who had introduced the piece to his daughter, summarized the debate.</p>

        <p>“It’s art, man. It’s art,” he said. “We all know what it’s for.”</p>
